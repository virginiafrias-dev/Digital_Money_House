## Steps to run the app

First, install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
#or
yarn
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
```

## Steps to run tests

> ### Important!
>
> I had some issues of compatibility between Babel and TurboPack. To run the tests remove the "#" from the "#babel.config.js" file's name and add it back when trying out the app.

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn run test
```
